                <h3>Profile</h3>
                <p>
                    My wife and I live in South Jordan, Utah where I enjoy doing home improvements and yard work. I also enjoy reading and playing the piano and organ.
                    Professionally I have been working as a Front-End Web Developer since 2009, and have worked at companies like the Space Dynamics Laboratory, Western Governors University, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently employed with the LDS church where I enjoy working on church education, welfare, and family history sites. These sites are translated into hundreds of languages and receive a high amount of traffic daily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My most important role is that of husband, and I hope eventually father. Family is the most important thing for me, and they give me the most strength.
                </p>
